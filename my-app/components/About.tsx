        Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Sergio. I am a second-year university student majoring in Computer Science at Mcgill University. I am passionate about solving challenging technical problems with real-world impact. My current interests lie in full-stack development as well as machine learning and AI. I am also pursuing a minor in Statistics as part of my undergraduate degree. My hobbies include reading books, watching movies, and listening to the same song on repeat until I get tired of it. Feel free to reach out with any exciting opportunities as I am always looking for a new challenge.        </p>
